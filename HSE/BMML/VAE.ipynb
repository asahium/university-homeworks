    "\n",
    "#### Discussion of VLB\n",
    "\n",
    "One can show that the gap between VLB $L(x; \\phi, \\theta)$ on log-likelihood and the log-likelihood $\\log p_\\theta(x)$ itself is KL-divergence between proposal and aposteriori distributions over $z$: $KL(q_\\phi(z | x) || p_\\theta(z | x))$.\n",
    "Maximum of $L(x; \\phi, \\theta)$ with fixed $\\theta$ is achieved when $q_\\phi(z | x) = p_\\theta(z | x)$.\n",
    "Nevertheless, $p_\\theta(z | x)$ is untractable, so instead of numerically computing it, VLB is optimized w. r. t. $\\phi$ using backpropagation and reparameterization trick (see below).\n",
    "The closer $q_\\phi(z | x)$ to $p_\\theta(z | x)$, the more precise is VLB.\n",
    "The true posterior distribution $p_\\theta(z | x)$ often cannot be decribed by one Gaussian, so the gap between VLB and LL never reaches zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term of VLB - $\\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim q_\\phi(z | x)} \\log p_\\theta(x | z)$ - is called reconstruction loss.\n",
    "The model describes this term is an autoencoder with one stochastic layer which tries to restore input object $x$.\n",
    "If $q_\\phi(z | x)$ is a delta-function, then an aoutoencoder with a stochastic layer turns into an ordinary autoencoder.\n",
    "That is why $q_\\phi(z | x)$ and $p_\\theta(x | z)$ are called encoder and decoder respectivelly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $KL(q_\\phi(z | x) || p(z))$ is called regularizer.\n",
    "It forces $z \\sim q_\\phi(z | x)$ to be close to $0$.\n",
    "But, as described above, it also forces $q_\\phi(z | x)$ to be close to $p_\\theta(z | x)$, which is even more important.\n",
    "Somebody use a coefficient before KL-divergence or even a different regularizer.\n",
    "Naturally, after that optimization of VLB usually becomes unrelated to the log-likelihood of the initial probabilistic model.\n",
    "This decreases intrpretability of the model and avoids theoretical guarantees.\n",
